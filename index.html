<p>The Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (formerly JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings) is a series aimed specifically at publishing machine learning research presented at workshops and conferences. Each volume is separately titled and associated with a particular workshop or conference and will be published online on the PMLR web site. Authors will retain copyright and individual volume editors are free to make additional hardcopy publishing arrangements (see for example the <a href="http://www.mtome.com/Publications/CiML/ciml.html">Challenges in Machine Learning</a> series which includes free PDFs and low cost hard copies), but PMLR will not produce hardcopies of these volumes. </p>

<h2>Editors</h2>

<p>The Series Editors are <a href="http://inverseprobability.com">Neil Lawrence</a> and <a href="http://people.cecs.anu.edu.au/user/2675">Mark Reid</a>. Please send proposals for new volumes under this series to Neil and Mark via e-mail: <a href="javascript:GoAddress('mark','reid.name');">mark<img src=/img/atr.gif border=0>reid.name</a> and <a href="javascript:GoAddress('N.Lawrence','sheffield.ac.uk');">N.Lawrence<img src=/img/atr.gif border=0>sheffield.ac.uk</a>. Each proposal should include:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>A brief description of the event's scope and topics to be covered.</li>
  <li>A description of the review process for the proceedings.</li>
  <li>The names and short CVs (a few lines) of the proposed Proceedings Editors. </li>
</ul>
