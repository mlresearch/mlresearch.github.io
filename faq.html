<h1>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>The Proceedings of Machine Learning Research are very much a
community effort. Thanks are particularly due
to <a href="http://www.clopinet.com/isabelle">Isabelle Guyon</a> for
working closely with us in preparing early
volumes, <a href="http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/">Nicola
Talbot</a> for preparing the LaTeX class file
and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/">Leslie Pack
Kaelbling</a> for supporting the launch in the first place.

  <h2>There's a Mistake in a Paper: Can it be Fixed?</h2>
  
  <p>If the mistake is a clear typo (e.g. abstract or authors not matching to the PDF) you can submit a pull request to fix it. 
    Simply click the "edit" button on the abstract page and if you are logged into GitHub you will be able to edit the meta information directly. If the change is more involved then you need to get permission of the proceedings editors. Please report how you got that permission in the pull request (i.e. what the circumstances were, who the individual who gave you permission was).
  </p>
    
  
<h2>How do I publish my proceedings with you?</h2>

<p>Email the series editor with your planned event. You need to
provide brief CVs of the organizers and an overview of the subject
matter. Potential proceedings are judged on the basis of the
appropriateness of the material, the perceived quality of the workshop
  and the track record of the organizers.</p>

<h2>I would like to register a Reissue Proceedings with you?</h2>

<p>You will need the support of the original conference organizers. When you have this email the series editors with your planned reissue. The reissue proceedings need to be provided in the format detailed here <a href="./spec.html">here</a></p>
  
<h2>What Volume Number will my Proceedings be?</h2>

<p>When you are close to finalizing the proceedings, email the series
editor. He will give you a volume number by allocating from those
currently available.

<h2>What if I want a Paper Copy?</h2>

<p>You are free to organize a hard copy of your proceedings for your
workshop, although PMLR does not provide the support for
this. Previous editors have made use of Microtome. See the <a href="http://www.mtome.com/Publications/CiML/ciml.html">Challenges in Machine Learning</a> series here which is made up of volumes from PMLR. <a href="http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/">Nicola
Talbot</a> has created a LaTeX <a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/apps/makejmlrbookgui/">package</a> for creating books from the proceedings.

<h2>Should the Call for Papers be Before or After the Workshop?</h2>

<p>This is up to you. You can make the proceedings a pre-proceedings
or a post-proceedings. Some conferences, like AISTATS 2010, do the
call before the workshop and put the proceedings on line in time for
  the event. Other will finalize their proceedings after the event.</p>

<p>Overall our advice would be for larger proceedings and more formal conferences, get them up <i>before</i> the event, for smaller proceedings and less formal workshops it can make sense to produce them after the event.</p>

<h2>What is the Style File for the Proceedings?</h2>

<p>There are two style files, a two column style file (see for example the AISTATS volumes) or a one column style file similar to the standard JMLR style (although you'll need to set the header to read "Proceedings of Machine Learning Research" instead of "Journal of Machine Learning Research"). As of 2010 <a href="http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/">Nicola Talbot</a> has kindly put together a LaTeX package for these styles. It is available <a href="http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/jmlr">here</a>. We don't support preparation systems other than LaTeX.

<h3>Software for Supporting Proceedings Preparation</h3>

<p>As of 2012 <a href="http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/">Nicola Talbot</a> has prepared a Java Application for assisting in preparing a PMLR proceedings. It is available <a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/apps/makejmlrbookgui/">here</a>. Many thanks to Nicola.

<h2>What do I Need to Provide for the Proceedings?</h2>

<p>You should appoint a publications chair (who could also be one of the editors, but needn't be: for larger conferences it is often a separate role, but for smaller workshops it tends to be an editor). The publications chair will be responsible for compiling the proceedings. </p>

<p>The proceedings are provided in the format detailed <a href="./spec.html">here</a>.
<p>As well as the papers in the format described above, you will need to provide permission to publish forms from your authors. Please distribute the form found <a href="./pmlr-license-agreement.pdf">here</a> to your authors. Have them sign a copy and send you a scanned PDF. The scanned PDF should be named with the convention given above with the suffice <code>Permission</code> e.g. <code>turner10aPermission.pdf</code>. These files should be placed in a <i>separate</i> directory from the other material called <code>vXpermissions</code> and sent the series editor. 

  <h2>I'm an editor: How do I make changes to a published proceedings?</h2>

  <p>To do this you'll need to have a github account. Some familiarity with git will help a lot.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>For smaller changes, you just need to be logged into your github account, go to the abstract page of the paper you want to change and click on the ‘edit’ button.</p>

      <p>You’ll then go straight to the relevant file and you can edit it directly (note that title and author changes need to be made in two fields, there is one normal field and one for bibtex/latex).</p></li>

    <li>For larger changes, you may need to use the more traditional approach to pull requests. You should</li>
    <ol>
      <li>"fork the repository" (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo">see here</a>) and then </li>
      <li>"clone it" (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">see here</a>) to your local drive.</li>
      <li>Make the changes locally and commit them and push them then</li>
      <li>submit a pull request (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">see here</a>)</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
<p>All of this allows us to use github’s mechanisms for version control to track changes to the proceedings.</p>
