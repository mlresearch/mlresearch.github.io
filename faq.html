<h1>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>The Proceedings of Machine Learning Research are very much a
community effort. Thanks are particularly due
to <a href="http://www.clopinet.com/isabelle">Isabelle Guyon</a> for
working closely with us in preparing early
volumes, <a href="http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/">Nicola
Talbot</a> for preparing the LaTeX class file
and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/">Leslie Pack
Kaelbling</a> for supporting the launch in the first place.

<h2>How do I publish my proceedings with you?</h2>

<p>Email the series editor with your planned event. You need to
provide brief CVs of the organizers and an overview of the subject
matter. Potential proceedings are judged on the basis of the
appropriateness of the material, the perceived quality of the workshop
and the track record of the organizers.

<h2>What Volume Number will my Proceedings be?</h2>

<p>When you are close to finalizing the proceedings, email the series
editor. He will give you a volume number by allocating from those
currently available.

<h2>What if I want a Paper Copy?</h2>

<p>You are free to organize a hard copy of your proceedings for your
workshop, although PMLR does not provide the support for
this. Previous editors have made use of Microtome. See the <a href="http://www.mtome.com/Publications/CiML/ciml.html">Challenges in Machine Learning</a> series here which is made up of volumes from PMLR. <a href="http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/">Nicola
Talbot</a> has created a LaTeX <a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/apps/makejmlrbookgui/">package</a> for creating books from the proceedings.

<h2>Should the Call for Papers be Before or After the Workshop?</h2>

<p>This is up to you. You can make the proceedings a pre-proceedings
or a post-proceedings. Some conferences, like AISTATS 2010, do the
call before the workshop and put the proceedings on line in time for
  the event. Other will finalize their proceedings after the event.</p>

<p>Overall our advice would be for larger proceedings and more formal conferences, get them up <i>before</i> the event, for smaller proceedings and less formal workshops it can make sense to produce them after the event.</p>

<h2>What is the Style File for the Proceedings?</h2>

<p>There are two style files, a two column style file (see for example the AISTATS volumes) or a one column style file similar to the standard JMLR style. As of 2010 <a href="http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/">Nicola Talbot</a> has kindly put together a LaTeX package for these styles. It is available <a href="http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/jmlr">here</a>. We don't support preparation systems other than LaTeX.

<h3>Software for Supporting Proceedings Preparation</h3>

<p>As of 2012 <a href="http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/">Nicola Talbot</a> has prepared a Java Application for assisting in preparing a PMLR proceedings. It is available <a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/apps/makejmlrbookgui/">here</a>. Many thanks to Nicola.

<h2>What do I Need to Provide for the Proceedings?</h2>

You should appoint a publications chair (who could also be one of the editors, but needn't be: for larger conferences it is often a separate role, but for smaller workshops it tends to be an editor). The publications chair will be responsible for compiling the proceedings. 

<p>The proceedings are provided in the format detailed <a href="./spec.html">here</a>.<!--should be provided in a standard format:

<ol>
<li>
The volume sits in a directory called <code>vX</code>, where <code>X</code> is the number of the volume. All pages and directories listed below are in that directory. It is this directory that is zipped or made into a tarball and sent for final publication.
</li>
<li>The front page (see e.g. <a href="/v9/">here</a>) lists the volume number and title of the proceedings. The editors are then listed, followed by a preface (written by the editors) and the papers in their proceedings order. The page numbers of each paper is given. Underneath the paper is a link to the abstract, the pdf and supplementary material (if any). A template front page is given <a href="template.html">here</a> based on AISTATS 2010. This page should be in the <code>vX</code> directory and called <code>index.html</code>.
<ul>
<li>Note the papers are normally in alphabetical order by first named author.</li>
</li>
<li>The <code>index.html</code> page has a time stamp indicating creation time at the bottom.</li>
<li>The pages of each paper are number consecutively starting with page 1 for the first page of the preface. These numbers are listed as given in the examples.</li>
</ul>
<li>
There is a standard naming convention for works associated with the same paper in the volume. It starts with the last name of the first author (no capitals), followed by the last two digits of the year followed by an 'a' for the first paper, a 'b' for the second etc.. E.g. for a paper by Turner et al in 2010 the base name would be <code>turner10a</code>. If there are many papers with the surname Li, the base name would be <code>li10a</code>, <code>li10b</code>, <code>li10c</code> etc.. Extensions are then added to the base name. For example the abstract has extension <code>.html</code> giving <code>li10c.html</code>.
</li>
<li>
Each paper has its own abstract page. For example see <a href="papers/v9/turner10a.html">here</a>. The abstract page has a time stamp at the bottom. The abstract page appear in the <code>vX</code> directory and has the extension <code>.html</code>
</li>
<li>
Each paper has its own subdirectory which follows the same naming convention as the abstract. For example the Turner et al. paper lives in the directory <code>v9/turner10a/</code>. You can check the listing of such a directory <a href="papers/v9/adams10a/">here</a>. 
</li>
<li>
In the subdirectory there will be a PDF version of the paper using the naming convention given above with the extension <code>.pdf</code>.
</li>
<li>
If a paper has supplementary material these files will be given a suffix of <code>Supple</code> on the naming convention (giving for example <code>turner10aSupple</code>. If the supplementary material is written work it will be in the form of a PDF file and it will be named <code>turner10aSupple.pdf</code>. Supplementary material in the form of code will be placed in a zip file or a tar.gz and given the appropriate extension (<code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code>). Supplementary material appears in the paper's subdirectory alongside the PDF version of the paper.
</li>
<ul>
<li>
If the supplementary material takes the form of a video or other large file, please make contact with the series editor to ensure that this is possible. We will deal with such requests on a case by case basis unless demand becomes high, when we will put a protocol in place.
</li> 
 </ul>-->
<p>As well as the papers in the format described above, you will need to provide permission to publish forms from your authors. Please distribute the form found <a href="./pmlr-license-agreement.pdf">here</a> to your authors. Have them sign a copy and send you a scanned PDF. The scanned PDF should be named with the convention given above with the suffice <code>Permission</code> e.g. <code>turner10aPermission.pdf</code>. These files should be placed in a <i>separate</i> directory from the other material called <code>vXpermissions</code> and sent the series editor. 

  <h2>I'm an editor: How do I make changes to a published proceedings?</h2>

  <p>To do this you'll need to have a github account. Some familiarity with git will help a lot.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>For smaller changes, you just need to be logged into your github account, go to the abstract page of the paper you want to change and click on the ‘edit’ button.</p>

      <p>You’ll then go straight to the relevant file and you can edit it directly (note that title and author changes need to be made in two fields, there is one normal field and one for bibtex/latex).</p></li>

    <li>For larger changes, you may need to use the more traditional approach to pull requests. You should</li>
    <ol>
      <li>"fork the repository" (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo">see here</a>) and then </li>
      <li>"clone it" (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">see here</a>) to your local drive.</li>
      <li>Make the changes locally and commit them and push them then</li>
      <li>submit a pull request (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">see here</a>)</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
<p>All of this allows us to use github’s mechanisms for version control to track changes to the proceedings.</p>
