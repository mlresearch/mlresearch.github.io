    pages = {1-7},
    abstract = {Vehicle multi-object tracking has significant applications in many fields. Existing methods struggle to address the challenges of nonlinear motion and prolonged occlusion in vehicle tracking. In this paper, an advanced tracker featuring a Nonlinear Noise Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter, namely DCMTrack, is designed to finely adjust measurement noise and significantly enhance the accuracy of target motion state predictions. An Adaptive Direction and Confidence Cost Matrix is designed to more precisely calculate trajectory direction and confidence, enhancing the accuracy of target association. Ultimately, a Category-Aware Initialization Mechanism that integrates target category and environmental information is proposed to minimize false trajectories and optimize the overall trajectory management process. We conducted extensive experiments on the VehiclesMOT dataset, validating its effectiveness.}

First, digital twin models for UAVs and satellites are constructed to enable real-time network state monitoring and decision support. Second, the joint optimization of task offloading, communication, and computing resources is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). By enhancing the actor network in the conventional DDPG method, the proposed algorithm dynamically balances training latency and energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that CC\_DDPG significantly outperforms benchmark heuristic algorithms in convergence stability and multi-objective optimization performance.}

    abstract = {Zero - Shot Object Counting (ZSC) focuses on counting objects of any class in a query image without the need for user - supplied exemplars. Recently, ZSC has attracted growing interest because of its broad applicability and higher efficiency when contrasted with Few - Shot Object Counting (FSC). Different from FSC, a significant problem in existing ZSC methods is their failure to efficiently recognize high - quality exemplar features. In this paper, we propose a Zero-Shot Object Counting network with Visual Feature Extraction and Language-Guidance (VELG). Through the visual feature extraction module, we progressively fuse the scale and geometric information of the exemplars. Meanwhile, we introduce a language-guidance module that helps the exemplar learn informative image-level visual representations and refine the exemplar features using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training. Extensive experiments on the FSC147 and CARPK datasets verify the accuracy and strong generalizability of the proposed approach.}

    abstract = { Natural products (NPs) are valuable resources for drug development, but accurately predicting their interactions with protein targets remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods, which primarily rely on either ligand-based approaches or hybrid feature-based methods that require protein pocket data. To address these limitations, we developed a Y-shaped machine learning framework that integrates NP structural data with protein sequence information. We constructed a comprehensive NP-protein interaction dataset and extracted features from NPs, including Atom Sequence Path (ASP), PubChem, and Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP), as well as protein features such as Amino Acid Composition (AAC), Conjoint Triad (CTriad), and Dipeptide Composition (DPC). Six machine learning models—Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Logistic Regression (LR)—were trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrated that NP-derived PubChem features and protein-derived DPC features were the most effective, with XGBoost achieving the best performance among all models. Our study provides an efficient and generalizable framework for NP-protein interaction prediction, significantly advancing the potential for drug discovery.}

    abstract = {Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced complex problem-solving capabilities by incorporating extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, managing error propagation over long inference chains remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named \textbf{P}lanning and \textbf{Re}flective \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{C}orrection that integrates two complementary mechanisms: planning phase and reflection phase. The planning phase decomposes complex queries into streaming sub-problems and generates detailed reasoning trajectories, while the reflection phase leverages corrective feedback from erroneous outputs to refine these trajectories. The datasets sampled through these two mechanisms are used for self-supervised training, further reinforcing the LLM’s reasoning capabilities. Experiments conducted on the multi-hop Question Answering dataset demonstrate that our approach enhances the model's ability to generate coherent and accurate reasoning paths. Ablation studies further reveal the distinct contributions of planning and reflection to the overall performance. Our results suggest that integrating anticipatory planning with reflective self-correction provides a promising avenue for robust long-range inference in LRMs.}

    abstract = {Gliomas are the most common primary intracranial malignant tumors, characterized by high heterogeneity, recurrence, and mortality. Accurate grading is essential for treatment planning and prognosis assessment. MRI, as a non-invasive modality, is widely used, but traditional diagnosis depends on expert experience, leading to subjectivity and inefficiency. AI-based automatic grading has made progress, yet challenges persist due to tumor boundary ambiguity, structural heterogeneity, and the ``black box" nature of AI models, limiting robustness, generalization, and interpretability. To address these issues, this study proposes a multi-instance causal representation learning-based network for glioma grading (MCRNet). MCRNet employs multi-instance learning to aggregate MRI slice features, effectively handling tumor heterogeneity. The causal-aware attention mechanism (CAAM) and causal-aware dynamic aggregation mechanism (CDAM) enhance feature selection and aggregation efficiency. Evaluated on BraTS2020 and a private clinical dataset, MCRNet improves robustness, generalization, and interpretability. It minimizes the performance gap between validation and test sets, reducing the AUC difference by up to 3.21\% compared to existing methods, demonstrating its potential for reliable clinical application.}

With its huge volume of information, rapid dissemination, diverse viewpoints and ambiguous correlations, it is difficult for traditional sentiment analysis methods to cope with it. This paper aims to construct a sentiment analysis model for online public opinion that can adapt to complex contexts. By means of the Scrapy crawler framework, the public opinion data about the ``problematic vaccines" on Sina Weibo is collected. A convolutional neural network situational awareness classification model that combines spatial features and word vectors is proposed. Firstly, preprocessing is carried out based on the spatial distribution characteristics of words in the text. Then, word vectors are constructed based on sentiment features. Finally, the model is constructed and trained. Through comparison with models such as Linear SVM and CNN+Skip-gram, the results show that this model has a certain improvement in both accuracy and recall rate. This paper provides more effective decision-making support and theoretical reference for the analysis of online public opinion, and realizes the improvement of the sentiment classification model in complex contexts.}

In order to tackle these challenges, the present study proposes a transfer learning methodology that leverages the insights gained from extensive datasets or pre-trained models to enhance the model's capacity for generalization. Furthermore, meta-learning methodologies facilitate the rapid adaptation of models to novel tasks using a limited number of samples by employing strategies that enhance the learning process itself. Concurrently, data augmentation techniques enhance both the diversity and volume of samples through the synthesis, expansion, or transformation of small datasets, thereby augmenting the model's generalization capabilities. The paper also presents an active learning method that uses the uncertainty and information gain of the model to automatically select the most valuable samples for labeling to optimize the training effect of the model. It solves the problem of obtaining large-scale annotated data in many practical scenarios, and provides efficient classification and analysis of small amounts of annotated data. Moreover, it serves as the basis of zero-sample learning, which has important knowledge transfer and application value. The paper concludes by showing that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of small sample data classification.}

High-precision abdominal image segmentation is crucial for lesion localization, organ measurement, and surgical planning. However, existing methods face challenges in local feature extraction and multi-scale information modeling. To overcome the limitations of Transformer-based approaches, such as insufficient local information perception, large model size, and high computational cost, we propose MUnet-Lite, a lightweight segmentation model. It combines the Mamba method with a U-Net architecture, incorporating a residual spatial modeling unit for enhanced feature extraction and an efficient decoding unit to reduce computation. Experiments on the Synapse dataset show that MUnet-Lite achieves a Dice score of 83.79\% and a Hausdorff distance of 16.43mm, with only 26.71M parameters and 925.9 GFLOPs, significantly lowering computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

Furthermore, we explore medal distributions based on event types, employing K-means clustering to observe different contributions by country and finds that field and swimming events are key across all countries but with varying importance. An examination of event selection on a country-to-country basis through correlation shows that if the host country selects stronger events, even potentially favoring those in which they can excel, their numbers of medals naturally increase.}

Traditional encoder-decoder models also suffer from semantic discontinuity and insufficient multi-scale feature interaction. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called the Structure Interaction Dehazing Network (SIDN), which leverages the advantages of the YCbCr color space in separating color and luminance to guide RGB feature extraction. SIDN consists of two core components: the Dual-space Feature Branch (DFB) and the Cross-Feature Block (CFB). The DFB integrates YCbCr features through the Phase Fusion Module (PFM) and Density-aware Feature Extraction Block (DFEB), enhancing texture recovery and guiding RGB feature reconstruction. The CFB improves multi-scale feature interaction and semantic alignment through an enhanced cross-layer mechanism.

By analyzing outputs from three NMT platforms (DeepSeek, Youdao, DeepL) against an official benchmark, the research identifies persistent challenges, including inconsistent terminology (e.g., ``critical infrastructure" vs. ``core facilities"), tense inaccuracies (``had been restored" vs. ``have returned"), and omissions of technical annotations (e.g., ``Hikari (fiber-optic)"). While DeepL and DeepSeek demonstrate superior semantic and structural fidelity, their outputs require adjustments to align with domain-specific standards. The proposed post-editing framework prioritizes terminological alignment with authoritative references, temporal precision to emphasize ongoing actions, and structural coherence to restore source-text logic. Full post-editing is advocated for formal contexts to achieve human parity, whereas light post-editing suffices for rapid delivery with minimal quality compromises. Industry data highlights the dominance of the ``machine translation + post-editing" model, adopted in 30.4\% of projects in 2023, underscoring its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, human expertise remains irreplaceable in addressing nuanced challenges such as cultural adaptation and contextual dependencies. The study concludes by advocating for AI-augmented post-editing tools to streamline workflows while preserving the ``humanistic core" essential for high-stakes translations. This synergy between technological advancement and human judgment is critical for advancing translation quality in the AI era, particularly in high-demand sectors like ICT.}

Simultaneously, combined with the attention mechanism, the model could focus on important features, further improving the screening accuracy. The experimental results showed that the constructed BiGRU-attention model performs excellently in the task of screening university faculty recruitment resumes. Compared with traditional methods, it significantly improved indicators such as the accuracy and recall rate. It could provide more efficient and intelligent decision support for university recruitment work, help universities select outstanding teaching talents that better meet job requirements, and promote the construction of teaching staff in higher education.}

This review systematically examines the advancements in artificial intelligence-based carbon emission forecasting, revealing the evolutionary dynamics between traditional statistical methods and data-driven models. A novel ``data-model-scenario" triadic analytical framework is proposed to deconstruct core challenges in this field. The study demonstrates that conventional approaches (e.g., ARIMA, grey models) exhibit structural deficiencies in high renewable energy penetration scenarios, including poor adaptability to abrupt changes and low cross-source data integration efficiency ($<$60\%). In contrast, data-driven methods (XGBoost, LSTM, Transformer) achieve significant accuracy improvements through dynamic modeling and feature decoupling. Hybrid paradigms integrating physical constraints and multimodal alignment show promise in bridging the mechanism-data gap, yet face persistent challenges: inefficient multi-source data fusion (feature alignment success rate $<$60\%), delayed response to sudden scenarios (recovery time $>$30 minutes), and computational-precision tradeoffs in edge deployment. The paper proposes a ``dual-driven" evolutionary path for hybrid modeling and constructs a multi-scale scenario linkage matrix, providing theoretical guidance for next-generation prediction frameworks. Emerging technologies such as digital twins and federated meta-learning are highlighted as critical directions for future research.}

By providing poisoned training data, the attacker injects hidden backdoors into the victim model, which causes the victim model to behave normally on normal inputs but produce attatter-specified malicious outputs on poisoned inputs embedded with special triggers. Backdoor attacks that inject data that appears to be labeled correctly to bypass human inspection are often referred to as clean label attacks." However, the existing clean label attacks have some limitations, such as requiring a high proportion of poisoned samples, relying on explicit triggers, or difficult to obtain complete training data.
In this paper, we propose CleanBattack, a clean label backdoor attack that only requires knowledge of the target category of training data, designs precise vectors as triggers, and combines synonym replacement to achieve attack injection. The experimental results show that the attack success rate of CleanBattack is 6.3\%and 15.9\%higher than that of the baseline, and the clean accuracy rate is 0.8\%and 0.9\%higher than that of the baseline, which proves that the method has significant advantages in concealment and effectiveness, expands the application scope of clean label attack, and makes existing defense methods have failure risk.}

Currently, for bark defects exhibiting multiple shapes and colors, spatial-domain-based semantic segmentation models often encounter issues with semantic information loss in regions where the color or shape changes, which can lead to incomplete segmentation results. In contrast, utilizing texture features in the frequency domain can reduce the interference caused by variations in color and shape for the model, thereby enabling more effective identification of bark defects. Therefore, in this paper, a Frequency-Enhanced network based on Adaptive Frequency Transformer (AFFormer) is proposed. First, we propose an Inverted Depth-wise Separable Stem to extract more texture information by expanding the number of feature map channels through inverted depth-wise separable convolution. Moreover, we adopt the Rectangular Self-Calibration Module to refine the AFFormer as the backbone network. This enhances the ability to localize bark defects with different shapes and extracts frequency characteristics that are beneficial for semantic segmentation. Finally, the Frequency-Enhanced Channel Attention module enhances the frequency features for semantic segmentation and fuses the spatial-domain feature maps to recover the local details, thereby effectively improving the segmentation accuracy of multi-scale bark defects.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative underwater image processing model that combines wavelet convolution and dilated convolution for noise reduction. The model employs wavelet transformation to decompose images into high- and low-frequency components for preliminary processing, followed by the use of dilated convolution to extract noise and image features. This approach effectively removes noise from underwater images. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can adaptively handle illumination and detail information across different scales, addressing challenges such as uneven lighting, low contrast color distortion, and suspended particle noise. The processed images exhibit significantly improved clarity and contrast, even in complex underwater environments.}

    abstract = {  Power operations take place in high-risk environments, such as high voltage and strong magnetic fields, making standardized procedures crucial. Employing object detection technology to monitor operational compliance enhances electrical safety. However, the presence of numerous elongated objects and background columnar interferences in power operation datasets significantly affects detection accuracy. To address this issue, we explore model structure improvements from an interpretability perspective. Using Grad-CAM heatmap visualization, we analyze the regions where the model focuses on detection targets. We propose a lightweight convolutional attention mechanism, LCA (Lightweight Convolution Attention), which significantly enhances YOLOv7's attention to elongated targets while reducing the impact of columnar interference. This improves both the model’s robustness and interpretability. Experimental results show that LCA outperforms classical attention modules such as SE, ECA, and CA, while maintaining a minimal parameter size. Specifically, the mAP of the extremely elongated and challenging sample ``operatingbar" increased by 4.4\%, and the mAP of the small target ``wrongglove" improved by approximately 2\%. This makes LCA well-suited for detecting elongated targets in complex power operation environments. }

However, if the WAF's rule set and detection strategy are flawed, its protection function may fail under certain conditions, making it difficult to ensure comprehensive application security. Existing WAF protection testing methods either rely on fixed attack payload datasets, which may lead to inefficient testing due to dataset limitations, or use machine learning to pre-train adversarial WAF models, which are not suitable for testing WAF services deployed in the real world.

To address this issue, we propose a new WAF evaluation technique based on fuzz testing. This method uses context-free grammars to generate diverse attack payloads and combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize mutation paths, thereby achieving systematic testing of WAF defense measures. Specifically, we predefine context-free grammars for SQL injection (SQLi) and cross-site scripting (XSS) based on expert knowledge to generate the initial input for fuzz testing and serve as seed payloads for subsequent mutations. Then, MCTS guides the mutation process by dynamically adjusting node weights to prioritize the exploration of promising paths, thereby improving test efficiency and effectiveness.

Experimental results show that our approach reduces the protection failure rate of SQLi and XSS to 48.80\% and 37.80\%, respectively, outperforming benchmark tools such as WAF-A-MOLE and SqlMap. In addition, the invalid payload rate is also reduced to 5.63\% and 6.72\% for SQLi and XSS, and the number of WAF queries is reduced by more than 22 times, demonstrating the excellent evaluation efficiency of our approach.}

Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the unpredictability of such assets, prompting the need for advanced predictive frameworks. The methodology encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and validation, with a focus on optimizing short- and long-term forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid GM-LSTM strategy significantly enhances prediction accuracy: GM excels in short-term forecasting (first 200 days) due to its efficiency with limited data, while LSTM outperforms in long-term scenarios by capturing complex temporal dependencies. A dynamic weight adjustment mechanism, incorporating profit (PI) and risk indices (RI), balances returns and risks. Sensitivity analysis reveals the model’s robustness under varying transaction costs (0.1\%–10\%), maintaining profitability even at higher cost levels. Key performance metrics—annualized return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown—validate the strategy’s superiority over benchmarks like buy-and-hold.

This approach improves GPR's capacity to identify and fit the nonlinear characteristics of black-box functions while also increasing regression accuracy. Secondly, in formulating the BO acquisition function, an adaptive gradient trust region adjustment method is utilized to bolster BO's search capabilities within high-dimensional solution spaces. Concurrently, a hybrid sampling strategy is implemented to generate more diverse sampling points, thereby enhancing BO’s ability to escape local optima. The proposed algorithm has been validated on three 60D multimodal complex functions as well as two engineering application problems and compared with other advanced variants of BO.

However, entropy-based tuning lacks structural regularization and can lead to overconfident misclassifications. In this paper, we introduce Confidence-Aware Contrastive Distillation (CaCoD), a lightweight and effective approach to improve the robustness and calibration of TPT. Our method leverages the confidence structure of test-time predictions by identifying high- and low-confidence samples, and aligning their feature representations through a contrastive distillation loss. This encourages semantically meaningful updates to the prompt embeddings without requiring labels or retraining. Experiments across 11 fine-grained datasets demonstrate that CaCoD consistently reduces calibration error and improves predictive reliability, while maintaining strong accuracy.

These logs record the activities and status information at all levels of the data center, including the operating status of the server, the traffic of network devices, and the operation records of applications. Log anomalies refer to the presence of records that do not conform to normal patterns or expected content in the log files that record the operating system's own operating events. Log analysis can help developers quickly locate the source of the fault. By analyzing the log data, they can determine the device where the fault occurred and the cause of the fault. At the same time, they can also conduct advance analysis based on the existing log data to discover potential problems.In this paper, the method of co-optimization of GAN and federated learning is adopted, which not only solves the problem of data silos, but also solves the problem of insufficient data.}

    author = {Liu, Jinjin and Fan, Changchang},
    pages = {768-778},
    abstract = {Image-Text Retrieval(ITR), a crucial task in multi-modal learning, aims to achieve cross-modal information retrieval through semantic alignment and matching between images and text. With the advancement of deep learning, significant progress has been made in the accuracy and efficiency of ITR methods. However, existing approaches still face challenges such as modality heterogeneity, information redundancy, and insufficient multi-scale feature alignment between images and text. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Image-Text Retrieval method based on a Multi-scale Entropy-aware Fusion Network (MEFN). By introducing entropy-aware modeling and multi-scale attention mechanisms, this method enhances the correlation between image and text features, further improving cross-modal semantic matching capabilities. Specifically, MEFN first guides the fusion of image and text features through an entropy-aware model, then finely models multi-scale features using local and global attention mechanisms to generate efficient image-text fusion representations. Experimental results demonstrate that MEFN significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of image-text retrieval compared to mainstream methods on benchmark datasets such as Flickr30K and MSCOCO, especially showing superior performance in fine-grained object matching and complex scenarios. This study provides a new perspective for image-text retrieval methods and holds promise for further applications in multi-lingual image-text retrieval and video-text retrieval fields. }

    abstract = {Multimodal relation extraction, as an important research direction in the field of information extraction, aims to identify entities and objects from both text and images and establish cross-modal semantic associations. Current mainstream methods still face challenges in handling complex multimodal data, such as semantic alignment confusion and redundant associations, which lead to erroneous associations between irrelevant entities and objects, severely affecting system performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal relation extraction framework that integrates knowledge graphs. This approach uses the knowledge graph as external semantic support to filter candidate entity-object pairs through structured semantic information, and leverages a multimodal alignment module to achieve precise semantic matching. Experimental results show that this method significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmark datasets, especially in fine-grained relation recognition, where the F1 score increases by 4 percentage points, effectively demonstrating the framework's ability to mitigate cross-modal noise interference.}

The combined model based on xgboost and stacking algorithm was constructed, and the parameters were optimized by cross validation and grid search method. Taking Dalian port as an example, the experiment shows that when xgboost stacking model is used to predict port throughput, MAE, MAPE and RMSE are the lowest, and $R^2$ is the highest. The prediction performance is significantly better than other models, which verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the model in port throughput prediction, and provides a new method and idea for port throughput prediction.}

    pages = {808-818},
    abstract = {Existing Chinese text similarity calculation methods typically focus on a single dimension, resulting in insufficient information integration and difficulty in comprehensively merging semantic, feature, and structural information. To address this issue, a Chinese text similarity calculation model that integrates deep and shallow similarities has been proposed. The model first utilizes a Siamese neural network to obtain dynamic vector representations of the texts, further extracting features and calculating deep semantic similarity. Next, based on traditional edit distance algorithms, an improved component-weighted edit distance algorithm is designed by introducing tokenization and assigning weights to different parts of speech, to more accurately reflect the lexical-level shallow features and structural information of the texts. Finally, by linearly weighting and fusing deep semantic similarity with shallow feature similarity, a more comprehensive text similarity evaluation is achieved. Experimental results show that in experiments based on Chinese STS-B and Chinese SICK datasets, the Spearman correlation coefficients improved by 4.34 and 3.76, respectively, compared to the baseline model Siamese-RoBERTa. This model effectively enhances the performance of Chinese short text similarity calculation and better aligns with the expression habits of Chinese texts.}

    abstract = {Bitcoin, a digital currency facilitated by blockchain technology, enables direct exchange and personal ownership of digital assets, verified through mathematical consensus. This paper explores and analyzes transaction data within the Bitcoin network, with a focus on improving the efficiency of entity recognition methods and identifying illegal transaction patterns. We begin by introducing Bitcoin's development background, underlying principles, and transaction processes. We then delve into the structure of Bitcoin transaction data and review recent literature on its analysis, summarizing key technologies and research directions. To address the inefficiencies of traditional heuristic entity recognition methods, we propose an innovative solution that establishes entity relationship sets and utilizes active address data. Our approach introduces specific advancements, including a novel algorithm designed to enhance network connectivity and stability, and a centrality aggregation index that outperforms traditional node centrality indices. This algorithm facilitates quick reconnection to previously successful peer nodes, discovers new nodes upon connection loss, and propagates node information across the network for more stable connections. Additionally, it employs a seed node mechanism to expedite network discovery. Our method leverages a core data structure that maintains a list of peers for initial connections, automated through a seed node process. This bootstrapping mechanism allows Bitcoin clients to efficiently connect to the entire Bitcoin network. For implementation and analysis, we utilize NetworkX, a Python package for manipulating and investigating complex networks. We visualize the network structure using the number of transactions or reviews as node size, average review sentiment as node color, review mistrust as edge length, and a force-directed algorithm for node positioning. Our results demonstrate that the first-order aggregation centrality index performs better than the node centrality index, confirming that incorporating more information about first-order correlation attributes around a node enhances the model's effectiveness. Our proposed model, integrating the centrality aggregation index, achieves a 1\% improvement in precision, a 5\% improvement in recall, and a 4\% improvement in F1 score compared to the original feature set model. We define C as the node centrality feature set, C1 as the first-order aggregated feature set, C2 as the second-order aggregated feature set, and AF as the original feature set. From both model performance and visualization perspectives, the centrality aggregation index enables quick identification of key nodes and enhances the discovery of illegal transaction patterns in the network. By reversing and backtracking the capital flow path, our method can uncover more illegal transaction nodes and provide greater interpretability for the illegal transaction model. Finally, we discuss how to analyze and identify illegal behavior characteristics in Bitcoin transaction data, concluding with an examination of data sources, network construction, and analysis methods. By offering a comprehensive exploration of Bitcoin transaction data and advancing entity recognition methods, this paper provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Our proposed innovations result in significant efficiency improvements and enhanced detection of illegal activities within the Bitcoin network.}
