# PMLR Homepage

This is the home page of the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, the offshoot of JMLR associated with workshop and conference proceedings.

Creation of a new proceedings is two step. Firstly, when a new proceedings is approved carry out the following steps.

1. Each proceedings is set up as a different repository under the mlresearch github organization. 
2. To create a new proceedings, simply create a repo named ```vNN``` where ```NN``` is the volume number. 
3. In the description of the proceedings add the brief overview (e.g. Proceedings of AISTATS 2012).
4. Add the PMLR Group to the repository and give them "write" permmission.

You can carry out these steps by following [this link](https://github.com/organizations/mlresearch/repositories/new).

# When Proceedings are Ready

There are scripts in:

<https://github.com/mlresearch/papersite/>

Which allow the new proceedings to be created. See the readme on this page:

<https://github.com/mlresearch/papersite/tree/master/ruby>

for details.

Once those proceedings are ready, and have been checked by the proceedings editors, then you can trigger a recompile of this site to ensure that the list of proceedings is updated. This is best done by editing the `index.html` to remove the updated volume from the "Scheduled Volumes" list. New volumes are automatically added to the list under "Proceedings".
